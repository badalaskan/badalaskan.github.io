## Alex Kimball Williams
Hey, I'm a community researcher & environmental artivist (artist + activist) working at the intersections of community organizing and environmental research. Focuses of my work include climate justice, public policy, and public health.  

Currently I work as Project Manager of the $20m NSF-funded project "Rising Voices, Changing Coasts" (RVCC), a coastal research project bringing together scientists and traditional knowledge-holders to address issues at the frontlines of climate change. Our project supports the convergence of disciplines and epistemologies where Indigenous and local knowledge-holders from diverse coastal regions will work with university-trained social, ecosystem, and physical Earth system scientists and students on transformative convergence research to address coastal hazards in the contexts of their communities and cultures.  


My background is primarily in data analysis, survey design, grants management, and community engagement.
